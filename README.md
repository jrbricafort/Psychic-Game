The goal of this assignment is to improve our effectiveness with JavaScript. We had to create a game that picked a letter and gave real time feedback to whether or not the user guessed what the game wanted. The difficult part was setting it up so non letters would not count as guesses.

Technologies used included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

This is a letter guessing game where you, the user, have to guess a letter that the computer has chosen. 

You have 10 guesses to guess the letter the computer has chosen. Your guesses refresh upon either a win or loss. 

Non-letters do not count as guesses. Good luck!
